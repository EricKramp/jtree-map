# jtree-map

In preparation for for my first climbing trip to Joshua Tree National Park, I started researching routes and was very quickly overwhelmed by the sheer number and the difficulty of keeping track of location names I had no context for. What I really wanted was a map view that would help me identify even the general area of the park that had climbs that matched our interests and skill level.

REI's Mountain Project is a great, but slightly scrappy community/app for collecting information about routes, but their mapping features couldn't display the right set of filters for our group's skill levels/interests on a map. However! They graciously provide an API that allows anyone to filter/export route information as a structured dataset.

Taking that raw data I created a simple MapBox visualization that allowed us to browse Bouldering & Sport Climbing routes by location. If you select a location it will show you what routes start there and link to their pages on Mountain Project for more info.
